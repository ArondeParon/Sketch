# Sketch

Sketch is a drawing tool with a twist; it allows you to draw in pseudo 3D. Sketches can be saved by users and viewed in a gallery.

The front end is built using the HTML5 canvas element and plenty of JavaScript. Sketches are saved in a MySQL database and PHP is used as a mediator between front end and server side.

Curious about how this looks in action? [Check out the live demo.](http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/sketch).
